# Building
Requirements: A program for developing C# programs. (ex. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-2017-rc/)
 or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/))

- Go to `%APPDATA%` on Windows or `~/.config` on Linux and create the directory `Julien12150`, then `CityBot` inside of that.

- Create a file named `token.txt` in the `CityBot` directory, and put your bot's token inside of it.

- Open the `CityBot.sln` file inside your C# developing program, then compile the bot.
